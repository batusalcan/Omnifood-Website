## About This Project

I built this project as part of the **"Build Responsive Real-World Websites with HTML and CSS"** course on Udemy by Jonas Schmedtmann.

This is the main project of the course, where I applied all the skills I learned. While I followed the course's step-by-step guide, I personally wrote every line of code and put the design together myself.

This project was a great way to strengthen my skills in:
* Planning and designing a website (following the 7-step process taught in the course).
* Modern HTML5 and CSS3 (including Flexbox and CSS Grid).
* Applying web design principles (like typography, colors, and layout).
* Making websites responsive for all screen sizes.
* Adding simple JavaScript for interactions (like sticky navigation).

## Features

* **Fully Responsive Design:** Looks great on all device sizes, from large desktops down to mobile phones.
* **Desktop-First Workflow:** Built starting from the desktop layout and then adapting it for smaller screens.
* **Modern CSS Layouts:** Uses modern CSS3 features like Flexbox and CSS Grid.
* **JavaScript Interactions:** Includes smooth scrolling for links and a sticky navigation bar that appears on scroll.
* **Web Design Principles:** A clean, modern design based on good typography, color choices, and spacing.
* **Optimized Assets:** Optimized images, etc.

## Built With

* **HTML5:** For the semantic structure and content.
* **CSS3:** For all styling, layout, and responsiveness.
* **JavaScript (ES6+):** For dynamic features like smooth scrolling and sticky navigation.
* [**Ionicons**](https://ionicons.com/)**:** For the icons used throughout the site.
